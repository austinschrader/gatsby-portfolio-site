## About me

I've always been passionate about entrepreneurship and technology. I majored in Accounting at the University of Oregon, and graduated in 2017. That degree led me into the world of technology.

Before long, I was entranced. From there, I took Python I, Python II, C++, Database and Web Development courses.

At every job I've progressively applied the awesome powers of coding to my job. Then in 2020, I went deeper and signed up for a full time coding bootcamp, Epicodus.
